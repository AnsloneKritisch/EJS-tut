What  is EJS -> Embeded Javascript 

Till now we have been rendering all our html files in the server.js files
After that we have rendering all the output by res.send("Details");

All was diretly on the server , but what if we want that my input files and output files are both are html files and on the server.

Till now we have been rendering out input page of html where user would give their input and output files was resm.send("Details"); , but now we have will give a output files as html

We are going to use EJS templates for that !
